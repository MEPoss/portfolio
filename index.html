          <h1>My name is Ugo Possenti.</h1>
          <p>I'm an Italy-based UI/UX Designer and this is my personal website.
            I really love well designed apps so, when I was studying Aerospace Engineering, I decided to redesign the Android version of <a href="https://medium.com/@MEPoss/ora-infostud-non-fa-pi%C3%B9-schifo-21720720e556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infostud</a> –
            the app of the biggest university in Europe – since it was lacking updates and its decade-old design really needed a fresh coat of paint.
            In 2015 – thanks to the amazing people at Laboratorio Grafite – I had the opportunity to create and design <a href="https://www.iphoneitalia.com/556921/lexi-giochiamo-con-il-genere-e-il-numero-delle-parole" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexi</a>,
            an iOS game about italian words that let people know more about our beautiful and diverse language.
            Now I'm trying to find my way in the design world in order to make a
            living out of my passions. I'm a proud nerd who loves everything tech and is really into comics so if you want to know more about my journey,
